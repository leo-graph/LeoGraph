# LeoGraph

LeoGraph is a ClickHouse fork focused on adding analytical property-graph query
capabilities to ClickHouse.

The project goal is to let ClickHouse users query graph-shaped data with
standard `GQL` while continuing to use ClickHouse's native storage, execution,
and operational model. LeoGraph is not intended to become a standalone OLTP
graph database. It is aimed at analytical graph workloads: graph pattern
matching, multi-hop analysis, graph-shaped projections, and future graph
algorithms over data that already lives in ClickHouse tables.

## Current Status

The active development focus is the `GQL` parser and normalized graph AST.

Implemented or actively maintained:

- `Dialect::gql` routing through `ParserGQLQuery`.
- `GQLParserUtils::parseStatement` as the production parser entry.
- ANTLR4-generated parser sources from `src/Parsers/graph/grammar/GQL.g4`.
- A ClickHouse-native `IAST` graph AST under `src/Parsers/graph/AST`.
- `GQLParseTreeVisitor` split by query, projection, pattern, expression, DML,
  DDL, and type translation units.
- Parser contract tests in `src/Parsers/graph/tests/gtest_gql_parser.cpp`.

Not implemented yet:

- Runtime interpretation and lowering of `GQL*` AST nodes into a ClickHouse
  `QueryPlan`.
- Persistent graph catalog execution.
- Graph-specific execution operators such as expand and multi-hop traversal.
- Full `OpenGQL` session and transaction command support.

In the current parser-only phase, a syntactically supported `GQL` statement can
parse successfully and still fail later with `UNKNOWN_TYPE_OF_QUERY`, because no
graph interpreter is registered yet. Parser gaps fail earlier with `SYNTAX_ERROR`
or an explicit `Unsupported GQL ...` exception.
