# LeoGraph

LeoGraph is an analytical property-graph query layer being built on top of
ClickHouse. It aims to support standard `GQL` over data stored in ordinary
ClickHouse tables, while reusing ClickHouse's `MergeTree` storage, vectorized
execution, distributed query infrastructure, settings, and resource tracking.

The project is currently transitioning from parser-first work into the first
interpreter / lowering path. The main stable contract is still `GQL text ->
normalized GQL IAST`, and supported query roots now enter an initial
`InterpreterGQLQuery` / `GQL::PlanBuilder` lowering pipeline. Graph catalog
execution and real graph storage integration are still future work.

## Goals

- Reuse ClickHouse storage instead of introducing a standalone graph store.
- Represent graph data through table mappings for vertex and edge tables.
- Parse standard `GQL` with an ANTLR4-based parser derived from the OpenGQL
  grammar.
- Build an explicit, ClickHouse-native `GQL*` AST that later interpreter and
  lowering code can consume without reparsing source text.
- Target analytical graph workloads such as pattern matching, multi-hop
  traversal, graph-shaped aggregations, and graph algorithms.

## Non-Goals

- Replace transactional graph databases for OLTP graph workloads.
- Add a new storage engine in the current parser phase.
- Infer graph semantics from formatted source text in later interpreter code.
- Route graph-looking input through ordinary ClickHouse SQL parsing. Production
  `GQL` parsing is selected explicitly through `Dialect::gql`.

## Current Status

| Area | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `GQL` grammar | Active | Local grammar lives at `src/Parsers/graph/grammar/GQL.g4`. |
| Parser entry | Implemented | `ParserGQLQuery` calls `GQLParserUtils::parseStatement`. |
| AST layer | Active | Graph nodes live under `src/Parsers/graph/AST` and inherit from `IAST` or `ASTWithAlias`. |
| Visitor | Active | `GQLParseTreeVisitor` is split by query, projection, pattern, expression, DML, DDL, and type handling. |
| Parser tests | Active | Contract tests live in `src/Parsers/graph/tests/gtest_gql_parser.cpp`. |
| Interpreter / lowering | Active MVP | `GQLSingleQuery` and `GQLCombinedQuery` enter `InterpreterGQLQuery`; reusable helpers under `src/Interpreters/GQL` lower supported source and pipeline clauses while unsupported shapes fail closed. |
| Graph catalog execution | Design only | `catalog.md` describes the target table-mapping model. |
| Graph operators | Initial boundary | `Graph::MatchStep` and `Graph::MatchSource` define the current source contract; real expand / traversal operators remain design work. |

## Parser-Only Contract

The current production parser path is:

```text
ParserGQLQuery
  -> GQLParserUtils::parseStatement
  -> gqlStatement
  -> statement EOF
  -> GQLParseTreeVisitor
  -> GQL* IAST
```

The stable query root shapes are:

- `GQLSingleQuery` for linear query and DML clause sequences.
- `GQLCombinedQuery` for set queries such as `UNION`, `UNION ALL`, and `EXCEPT`.
- `GQLSubquery` for nested procedure bodies.
- `GQLCatalogStatement` for catalog DDL.

Parser work should preserve these root shapes unless a later design explicitly
changes the interpreter contract.
